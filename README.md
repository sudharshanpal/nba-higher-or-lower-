# Basketball Higher or Lower

Basketball Higher or Lower is a simple game where players guess whether a hidden NBA player’s statistic is higher or lower than the one shown.

## How It Works
- A player and one of their stats (e.g. points, assists, rebounds) is displayed
- A second player is hidden
- Guess whether the hidden player’s stat is higher or lower
- Correct guesses increase your score
- One wrong guess ends the game
